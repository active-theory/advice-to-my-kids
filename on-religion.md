## On Religion

When I was growing up, and even today - religion is a major force in most people's lives. Looking at it in a vaccuum, it seems mind-boggling (to me) how much importance people give religion when it comes to making life choices. And it's not just an individual's choices - government policies are made along religious lines, wars are fought over religious, lives are lost over it.

Think about it? What makes someone a Christian, Jew, Hindu or Muslim?

If you choose to follow a religion - and you don't have to, but if you do - make sure that you recognise that it's your personal set of beliefs. You are not entitled to stuff them down others' throats.
